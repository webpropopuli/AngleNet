#Angular works like....

##From the menu as a link:
*navmenu.component.html sets a router link to ```/portfolio```
(use 'fetch-data' as a reference)

##The HTML for that pags is in 
```/portfolio.component.html``` (see ```fetch-data.comp...```)

##but the C# code is in 
SampleDataController.cs, so for us Portfolio.cs
